# Basic usage

## Crucifixion with saints Valentine and Carlo Borromeo

The parish church of Sant'Antonino Martire contains this work by Ercole Sarti, entitled _Crucifixion between saints Valentine_ and Charles Borromeo, believed to have been painted in the first half of the seventeenth century. It portrays the moment of execution that lies at the heart of the Christian tradition: the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at Golgotha, the place of the skull, which Sarti emphasizes with a sinister skull and cross-bones at the foot of the cross. Despite this grim marker, the atmosphere in the painting is serene, with its keynote given in a peaceful sky with its rich blue contrasting brightly with the lavish reds of the two saints beneath their God. 

The two figures flanking Christ’s lower body are the third-century Saint Valentine to the left and, to the right, Charles Borromeo, the Archbishop of Milan from 1564–1584 and cardinal of the Catholic Church. Saint Valentine holds the palm of martyrdom with a hand that is simultaneously pressed to his heart, looking upward at Christ. His gaze is mirrored by Charles Borromeo opposite him who clasps his hands together in a gesture of prayer and supplication. 

Christ’s body is lean and muscular, pinned upright against the wood behind him; his agony and suffering are not realistically represented, but the wounds from the nails are evident in his feet. With arms horizontally stretched across the canvas, he is turned slightly to the side, where he might almost be welcoming the Holy Spirit figured discreetly in the form of a dove in flight. Christ’s head is illuminated by a halo-like light emanating from his head. 

Echoing this supernatural radiance, the clouds form a rhomboidal bracket around Christ’s upper body, leaving a further zone of blue sky for the heads of the two saints below. Both saints are under the horizontal span of Christ on the cross, as if he were embracing them with open arms. This protective gesture on the part of Christ—even though he must be racked by pain—recalls Michelangelo’s description of his soul in a sonnet: ‘the soul, turned to that divine love who opens his arms upon the cross in order to take us’ (285.13–14).

## Madonna of the plague 

In this work, Sarti represents the fourteenth-century Saint Roch, the Virgin and the third-century Saint Sebastian interceding for the plague-stricken. In the foreground the populus lies languishing, piled up on top of one another, pale and either fighting for life or already dead. Their ailment is likely to be the terrible plague that ravaged northern and central Italy in the 1600s, wiping out more than half the population. Saint Roch on the left points to the people while looking upward to the Virgin, pleading for her intervention. Saint Roch is the patron saint of the sick and has historically been invoked in art history against the plague following the Black Death and the Italian plague epidemic of 1477–79. 

His status as pilgrim who suffered plague is essential in his iconography. In Sarti’s representation, his legs are bare, apparently displaying the plague bubo on his left leg, proof that he had triumphed over the disease. He is accompanied by a dog, alluding to the dog that brought him bread and licked his wounds when he was ill. Meanwhile, Saint Sebastian is tied to a tree, pierced with arrows, but poised and elegant with iridescent skin, triumphing over his impending death. Sarti creates a strong sense of dimension in the interlocking triangle between the three saints and Christ, guiding the viewer's eye to emphasize their intercessory powers. This sense of dimensionality is echoed through Sarti’s multiplicity of compositional layering: at once there is the terra firma that the saints stand on, but behind them is the ambiguous pit that the populus lies in—that is neither terra firma nor the green paddock behind them—they are part of another world of their own, the world of the sick and dying, which the saints seem to transcend. Adding to the separate horizontal planes is a town in the background, and sky and clouds.  

The Virgin emerges forth from her own zone which is comfortingly circular and buoyant, with the energy of heaven that only she and her Child and the angels are privy to. It is a highly contrasting zone that wedges down toward the sick. The Virgin emerges with a celestial golden light that is striking against the dark colours of her maphorion, and the putti stand out against the dark murky clouds, creating a strong sense of contrast and dimensionality in this heavenly orbit that will extend its grace and redemption to the dying.  These formal contrasts created by Sarti have great expressive power for a population in need of faith and solace.
