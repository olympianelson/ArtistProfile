Giovanni Lo Coco was born in 1667 to Paolo and Agata Grassi. Lo Coco was commonly referred to as "u surdu di Aci” or “U surdu di Jaci”, the deaf one of Acireale, on account of his hardness of hearing. He also referred to himself as ‘Acitanu’, referencing his hometown of Acireale in Catania, Sicily.

Lo Coco began his journey as an artist studying under Giacinto Platania, a Sicilian painter also from Acitano. Together, the two artists are indebted for the pictorial knowledge of the city from which they come. They aroused a desire for beauty in Acireale, with Platania working predominantly in oil and Lo Coco mainly in fresco. After working for Platania, Lo Coco then went to study in Rome under the direction of the celebrated Pietro Aquila, a highly esteemed engraver from Palermo who had established himself in Rome from about 1700. Lo Coco was highly influenced by the mannerism that dominated the Roman school, and learnt to imitate the manner of various painters who were a part of this tradition, in particular that of Titian. Lo Coco adopted the style that was prevalent at that time in the capital, but he did not dwell much on their study. Instead, with a quick brush (di veloce pennello) he was said to have painted in an unrestrained style (senza freno) even though not always visible in the works. But, despite this bravura, he stood out for his ability to create different faces.

According to Trovato and Grossi, Lo Coco is recognised as a painter who recalls a courtly and opulent society even when it has to represent the simplest moments of everyday life, or in a miraculous event. ‘One gets the impression of an enterprising and willful artist but academic and sweetened but lackadaisical in many of his formal solutions, even if he is a pleasing decorator.’ 
Trovato and Grossi say that at times one has the impression that one is dealing with ‘a kind of big comic story (storia a fumetti) complete with the didactic part constituted by Franciscan traditions that make you think more of a water-colourist than a fresco painter. Few of the elements in the lunettes painted by him reflect the humble skinny monk burdened by the heavy spiritual weight that made him famous and that drew him to live with abstentions and renunciations and to call all creatures his brothers and sisters.”

Around 1705, Lo Coco received a commission from Diego Pappalardo, the priest of Pedara and the chaplain of the Order of Malta, to carry out a series of frescoes in the Basilica Santa Caterina Pedara. There, Lo Coco is believed to have decorated the whole church with the stories of St. John the Baptist and St. Catherine of Alexandria in Egypt. In 1709 Lo Coco returned to his hometown, and that same year he received a payment of 15.3 onze for the painting of the chapel at S Antonio. In 1715, Lo Coco was commissioned to paint the frescoes of the church and cloister of the Convent of San Biagio, Acireale. Here he decorated large lunettes with episodes of the life of St. Francis of Assisi. These frescoes include scenes such as Blessed Jacoba of Settesoli throwing herself crying at a saint; kissing a leper; and a man spreading his cloak in front of the Saint. He completed the entire cycle between 1713 and 1715. The cycle was much appreciated by locals who praise Lo Coco for “good drawing and precision of contours” (buon disegno e precisione di contorni).

Lo Coco’s works can be found in the Pedara region of Sicily; near Trecastagni, there are frescoes painted in the local church by Lo Coco. His works can also be found in the church of the Convent of San Francesco di Biancavilla: there are two lunettes with the Nativity of San Francesco and the Baptism of San Francesco.

In a self-portrait inconspicuously placed in a cruciform vault in a portico, he portrays himself with ruddy chubby cheeks (le guance paffute ed arrossate), fashionably dressed with a flowing wig (parrucca fluente), holding a colourful handkerchief in his left hand (reca nella mano sinistra) and belonging to the golden age of aristocracy. He is believed to have died in 1721.
